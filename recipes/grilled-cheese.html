        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled cheese is a nostalgic meal for many. Nothing can beat the comfort of melted cheese sandwiched between toasted buttered bread!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tbsp. softened butter</li>
            <li> 4 slices sourdough bread</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread 1 tablespoon butter on one side of the bread. With butter side down, top each slice of bread with about &frac12; cup cheddar.</li>
            <!-- use &frac[number]; to write fractions-->
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add two slices of bread, butter side down. Cook until bread is golden and cheese is starting to melt, about 2 minutes. Flip one piece of bread on top of the other and continue to cook until cheese is melty, about 30 seconds more.</li>
            <li>Repeat for the second sandwich, wiping skillet clean if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
